# Github Project Board

[GCN Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-gcn/projects/6)

## Philosophy

We use github Projects to organize our development process.
We chose github Projects becase we already extensively use github Issues and Milestones.
[Github's Projects Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)

We have a total of six possible ticket states.

<Table bordered compact stackedStyle="headers">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Status</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No Status</td>
      <td>
        These are tickets that have not been fully groomed or pointed yet.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Backlog</td>
      <td>
        These are tickets that are fully groomed and pointed and are ready to
        go. They may be planned for a particular sprint or have no sprint
        attached.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>In Progress</td>
      <td>
        These are tickets that are under way. A user should be assigned to any
        tickets in progress.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>In Review</td>
      <td>
        We manually put tickets into review status when PRs are ready for
        review.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blocked</td>
      <td>
        This is for tasks that are blocked and waiting on something from a
        source other than the assigned user.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Done</td>
      <td>
        These are tickets that have merged PRs or completed tasks. Use github
        trigger words ("closes #123") to ensure tickets are linked to PRs and
        this will automatically happen on merge.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

They appear visually as columns on our project board as seen in this screenshot.

When you open a specific Issue while on the Project board, you will see ticket details open on the right hand side of the window. This is where you can find ticket metadata.

Project specific metadata can be found by scrolling down in the right hand Issue pane. There are other types of ticket metadata preceding and following this section. The github Project specific metadata section looks like the following screenshot.

  src={ticketMetadata}

  className="height-auto"
/>

We create Issues for all work. All Issues should have a detailed title, description, and acceptance criteria. All issues must be pointed before moving into the Backlog or In Progress. Some Project metadata is also editable from an Issue page.

## Pointing

We point tickets as a group during planning meetings.
We use the description and acceptance criteria written in the github Issue to ensure group understanding of the work.
Once we have agreed that we understand the scope and request, we vote on the level of complexity for that body of work.
We use the unique numbers in the fibbonacci sequence to represent complexity. We only go up to 21 points, making our options 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21. We also have the additional options of `coffee` or `question mark`.

<Table bordered compact stackedStyle="headers">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Complexity</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Something incredibly straightforward such as a copy fix.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>A small uncomplicated change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>The average bugfix or small feature</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>This is a more robust feature or a more complex bug</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>
        This is quite large. It may need to be broken down into smaller steps
        where possible.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>
        This is where we start deeply questioning. If a ticket is 13 points, it
        is possible that it is not broken down into small enough steps and would
        benefit from further breaking down. Or perhapse the acceptance criteria
        are too ambiguous.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>
        This is a wildly difficult task. This will take more than an
        iteration/sprint, likely more than one.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>coffee</td>
      <td>Abstaining from voting.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question mark</td>
      <td>
        This is used when the description or acceptance criteria are too vague
        to make an accurate estimate or there are any outstanding questions that
        would prevent accurate pointing.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Tickets with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria are pointed before being placed in the backlog.

## Iterations/sprints

We use both sprint and iteration to mean a two week period of work. Our github Project board uses iterations though these spans of work are more frequently known as sprints. Our team uses both words interchangeably.

## Planning Meetings

TBD.
