    """
    Class for retrieving Swift TLEs from the TLE database. If the TLEs are
    not found in the database, they are retrieved from either the supplied
    `tle_url`, or from the URL specified in the `tle_concat` attribute (in the
    concatenated TLE format), then written to the database.

    Attributes
    ----------
    tle_name
        Name of the spacecraft as it appears in the Spacecraft Catalog.
    tle_url
        URL to retrieve the TLE from.
    tle_concat
        URL to retrieve the TLE from in concatenated format.
    tle_bad
        If the TLE is this many days old, it is considered outdated, and a new
        TLE will be retrieved.
    tle_min_epoch
        Minimum epoch for which TLEs are available, typically this will
        correspond to a date after the launch of the spacecraft.
